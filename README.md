# OneZero

This project is currently still in progress but the end goal of this project is to create a database as well as a website which will serve as the interface to the database of our fictional computer company called OneZero.

I am leading this group project and we have divided the responsibilities in the following manner:
- Ron - Responsible for creating the conceptual desgin of the database.
- Edi - Responsible for creating the relational schema of the database.
- Omar - Responsible for creating the SQL code of the database.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I did not write the SQL code for the database, it is written by Omar Amzi, but I have reviewed and discussed it with him.

For more details please check out the documentation of the project.
